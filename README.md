# NODE-README-GENERATOR
# DESCRIPTION:
In my opinion, every project must have a quality README. I have looked through hundreds of README  files and never would have guessed, they could be created using the command-line. In this project, I used Node.js, a command-line application that briskly generates a README.md file based on questions created by myself.

# INSTALLATION:

* git clone starter code to your local repository.                                                                                                          
* Create .gitignore file before installing package dependencies.                                                                                            
* Run npm install to install package dependencies as specified in the package.json.                                                                          
* Inquirer will prompt you for your inputs from the command line.                                                                                            
* The application will start by running node index.js in the command line.                                                                                  
* Answer the prompts in your command line to generate the README.                      

# USAGE:
  When you run node index.js in the command-line, a series of questions about GitHub, your project information and contact information will be prompted. Very user friendly, because you only have to answer the questions.
